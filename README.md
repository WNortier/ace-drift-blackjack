# Ace Drift Blackjack

> ## The objective of the game is to get closer to the sum of 21 than the dealer, without exceeding 21.

### 1. Initial Deal:

- Each player is dealt two cards face up.
- The dealer is dealt two cards, one face up and one face down.

### 2. Player's Turn:

- Players can choose to "Hit" (draw a card) or "Stand" (keep their current hand).
- Players can continue to hit until they either stand or exceed 21 (bust).

### 3. Dealer's Turn:

- The dealer reveals their face-down card.
- The dealer must draw cards until their hand totals 17 or higher.
- If the dealer exceeds 21, they bust, and all remaining players win.

### 4. Winning:

- If a player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21, the player wins.
- If the dealer's hand is closer to 21, the dealer wins.
- If both the player and the dealer have the same total, it is a push (tie), and the player's bet is returned.

#### **Card Values:**

- Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.
- Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.

#### **Special Rules:**

- **Blackjack:** If a player is dealt an Ace and a 10-value card (10, Jack, Queen, King) as their initial two cards, they have a "Blackjack" and win 1.5 times their bet, unless the dealer also has a Blackjack, resulting in a push.

- **Insurance:** If the dealer's face-up card is an Ace, players can choose to take "insurance," a side bet that the dealer has a Blackjack. If the dealer has a Blackjack, the insurance bet pays 2:1.

#### **Dealer Rules:**

- The dealer must draw cards until their hand totals 17 or higher.
- The dealer must stand on all 17s, including "soft 17" (a hand containing an Ace valued as 11).
